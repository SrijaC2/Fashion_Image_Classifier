## Fashion Image Classifier

This project features a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using TensorFlow/Keras for classifying images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The model achieves an accuracy of 91%, demonstrating effective image classification and robust model evaluation techniques.

### Model Architecture
- **Convolutional Layers**: Three Conv2D layers with ReLU activation to extract features from the input images.
- **Pooling Layers**: Two MaxPooling2D layers to reduce the dimensionality and retain essential features.
- **Dropout**: A dropout layer with a rate of 0.5 to prevent overfitting.
- **Dense Layers**: Two fully connected Dense layers, the first with 56 units (ReLU activation) and the output layer with 10 units (softmax activation).

### Key Features
- **Input Shape**: `(28, 28, 1)` grayscale images.
- **Final Accuracy**: Achieved 91% accuracy on the test set.
- **Demonstrated Skills**: Image classification, model evaluation, and CNN architecture design.
